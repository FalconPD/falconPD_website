Twitter is a great place to share multimedia. A picture is worth a thousand
words, and a tweet is limited to 140 characters so sometimes the best way to get
your point across is with a video or image. Take today to tweet out a photo or a
video. Be sure to use one of the district hashtags in your tweet to participate
in the challenge. Lastly, take a moment to read over and favorite someone else's
tweet.
