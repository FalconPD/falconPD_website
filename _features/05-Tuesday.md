During your class or PLC meeting, take a moment to share an "A-Ha" moment that you've had. Feel free to share a picture or resource if it applies to your learning. Make sure to use the **#FalconPD** hashtag so others can find what you tweet. We will be using these tweets to make a twitter summary of learning in the district.
