It's time to grow your Personal Learning Network (PLN). Following relevant people on Twitter and participating in discussions is a great way to gain new followers of your own. Follow five new people from the education world who are interested in similar topics and cross your fingers for a "follow back." Send out a tweet about your growing PLN with **\#FalconPD** in it to participate in the Twitter Challenge.
