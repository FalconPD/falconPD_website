Join us as we continue to embrace Twitter as a means of ongoing professional
learning by participating in the five days of our challenge. Each day of the
week beginning on February 8th, you will be given a task to complete on Twitter.
Simply click on the tabs for each day of the week to learn what your challenge
will be. If you participate you will have the opportunity to win a $25 School
Specialty voucher. Six winners will be chosen: two from grades K-5, two from
grades 6-8, and two from grades 9-12.  The first winner will be chosen at random
and the second winner will be the person who has the tweet that receives the
most favorites. If you do not have a Twitter account, just click on the
[Sign Up](#Sign%20Up) tab and we will walk you through it.
