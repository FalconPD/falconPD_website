Welcome to the first ever **\#FalconPD** Twitter Challenge\! We invite you to join us as we embrace Twitter as a means for ongoing professional learning by participating in the five days of our challenge. Each day of the week beginning on October 12th, you will be given a task to complete on Twitter. Simply click on the tabs for each day of the week to learn what your challenge will be that day. If you participate all five days of the challenge, your name will be entered in a prize drawing. Six winners will be chosen: two from grades K-5, two from grades 6-8, and two from grades 9-12.  If you do not have a Twitter account, no worries. Click on the [Sign Up](#Sign%20Up) tab and we will walk you through it.  Good luck and happy tweeting!
