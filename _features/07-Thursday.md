Twitter is a great way to share resources with other teachers. Find a resource relevant to your professional development topic and tweet it out to your professional learning network. Your resource could be a link or a picture that you think will benefit your PLN. Be sure to include **\#FalconPD** in your tweet to participate in the Twitter Challenge.
