Every day this week we've been favoriting other tweets that we like, but what
if we like something so much that we want to share it with our PLN? That's
where retweets come in! When you retweet something you share another person's
tweet with all of your followers. Retweets are also a great way to find people
to follow. If you like someone's tweet who was retweeted, you can follow them
to see everything they tweet. Today, find a tweet that you like and retweet it
to your followers.
