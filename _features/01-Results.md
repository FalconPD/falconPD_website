During the week of October 12th, Monroe Township teachers competed in the &#35;FalconPD Twitter Challenge. Each day of the week they were given a different task to complete on Twitter. In the end, two teachers from each grade group (K-5, 6-8, and 9-12) who completed all five days were randomly chosen to win $25 vouchers for School Specialty. Out of the over 80 participants, the winners were:

* Stephanie Chin
* Rhonna Griffin
* Samuel Schneider
* Scott Zimms
* Christine Duane
* Sharon DeMarco
