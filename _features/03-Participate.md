With so many people tweeting, how do you have a conversation about one particular topic? That's where hashtags come in. A hashtag is a word of phrase preceded by a "\#". Hashtags help you focus on tweets around a specific topic. You can add a hashtag to any tweet by following the tweet with an appropriate hashtag and it will appear in the group. By putting one of the district hash tags at the end of your tweets you will be participating in our twitter challenge\!

Here is an example tweet:

	Working on coteaching skills today. Power of two! #FalconPD #education

Here are the hashtags we use in-district:

**\#FalconPD**, **\#There'sNoPlaceLikeOakTree**, **\#ApplegarthFalcons**, **\#WLCares**, **\#MillLakeIsGreat**, **\#BBRocks**, **\#WeAreBrookside**, **\#FabFalcons**, **\#GreatDayToBeAFalcon**

Hashtags are also used for scheduled chat sessions between teachers. A great resource for that can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/twittereducationchats/education-chat-official-list).
