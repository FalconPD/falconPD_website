With so many people tweeting, how do you have a conversation about one particular topic? That's where hashtags come in. A hashtag is a word of phrase preceded by a "\#". Hashtags help you focus on tweets around a specific topic. You can add a hashtag to any tweet by following the tweet with an appropriate hashtag and it will appear in the group. By putting \#FalconPD at the end of your tweets you will be participating in our twitter challenge\!
