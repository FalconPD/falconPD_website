Take a moment to reflect and ask yourself, "What has been my greatest insight
or discovery from this year's PD?" Twitter is a great medium for summative
reflection because you're limited to 140 characters. See if you can boil that
["aha moment"](http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Grampy-A-Ha-320.jpg)
you had down to a tweet. Tweet it out to your followers and favorite any other
reflections that resonate with you. Be sure to use one of the in-district
hastags to participate in the challenge.
